# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Required Compliance Gates

All features MUST pass the following gates from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

1. **Simplicity & Minimalism**: Does this maintain a simple, modular Python architecture using a package structure?
   - Are external dependencies absolutely essential?
   - Can this be achieved with Python 3.7+ standard library only?
   - Does the configuration remain INI-based and human-readable?
   - Does each module follow single responsibility principle?
   - Are modules kept under 400 lines where possible?

2. **Platform Neutrality**: Does this treat all Git platforms equally?
   - Are there platform-specific hardcoded paths or assumptions?
   - Is platform identification header-based only?

3. **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Is repository-specific logic in configuration?
   - Can behavior be changed via INI configuration without code changes?
   - Are we adding repository-specific code to the server?

4. **Security by Verification**: Are security requirements met?
   - Is signature/token verification supported for affected platforms?
   - Are secrets stored in configuration only (never hardcoded)?
   - Are SSL/TLS options preserved if applicable?

5. **Service Integration**: Does this maintain systemd compatibility?
   - Will the install script still work?
   - Are logs written to configurable file paths?

6. **Professional Commit Standards**: Do commits follow the required standards?
   - Are commit messages free of AI-generated attribution signatures?
   - Do commit messages follow the format: `类型: 简短描述` (Chinese description)?
   - Are valid commit types used (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore)?

### Violation Justification

If any gate above cannot be passed, document in the Complexity Tracking section below.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
